; config file for PrivateBin
; Lightly modified, taken from: https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/cfg/conf.sample.php
; An explanation of each setting can be find online at https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration.
[main]
; (optional) set a project name to be displayed on the website
; name = "PrivateBin"
; enable or disable the discussion feature, defaults to true
discussion = true
; preselect the discussion feature, defaults to false
opendiscussion = false
; enable or disable the password feature, defaults to true
password = true
; enable or disable the file upload feature, defaults to false
fileupload = false
; preselect the burn-after-reading feature, defaults to false
burnafterreadingselected = false
; which display mode to preselect by default, defaults to "plaintext"
; make sure the value exists in [formatter_options]
defaultformatter = "plaintext"
; (optional) set a syntax highlighting theme, as found in css/prettify/
syntaxhighlightingtheme = "sons-of-obsidian"
; size limit per paste or comment in bytes, defaults to 2 Mebibytes
sizelimit = 2097152
; template to include, default is "bootstrap" (tpl/bootstrap.php)
template = "bootstrap-dark"
; (optional) notice to display
; notice = "Note: This is a test service: Data may be deleted anytime. Kittens will die if you abuse this service."
; by default PrivateBin will guess the visitors language based on the browsers
; settings. Optionally you can enable the language selection menu, which uses
; a session cookie to store the choice until the browser is closed.
languageselection = false
; set the language your installs defaults to, defaults to English
; if this is set and language selection is disabled, this will be the only language
; languagedefault = "en"
; (optional) URL shortener address to offer after a new paste is created
; it is suggested to only use this with self-hosted shorteners as this will leak
; the pastes encryption key
; urlshortener = "https://shortener.example.com/api?link="
; (optional) Let users create a QR code for sharing the paste URL with one click.
; It works both when a new paste is created and when you view a paste.
; qrcode = true
; (optional) IP based icons are a weak mechanism to detect if a comment was from
; a different user when the same username was used in a comment. It might be
; used to get the IP of a non anonymous comment poster if the server salt is
; leaked and a SHA256 HMAC rainbow table is generated for all (relevant) IPs.
; Can be set to one these values: none / vizhash / identicon (default).
; icon = none
; Content Security Policy headers allow a website to restrict what sources are
; allowed to be accessed in its context. You need to change this if you added
; custom scripts from third-party domains to your templates, e.g. tracking
; scripts or run your site behind certain DDoS-protection services.
; Check the documentation at https://content-security-policy.com/
; Note: If you use a bootstrap theme, you can remove the allow-popups from the sandbox restrictions.
; By default this disallows to load images from third-party servers, e.g. when they are embedded in pastes. If you wish to allow that, you can adjust the policy here. See https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/FAQ#why-does-not-it-load-embedded-images for details.

; stay compatible with PrivateBin Alpha 0.19, less secure
; if enabled will use base64.js version 1.7 instead of 2.1.9 and sha1 instead of

[purge]
; minimum time limit between two purgings of expired pastes, it is only
; triggered when pastes are created
; Set this to 0 to run a purge every time a paste is created.
